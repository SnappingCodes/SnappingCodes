# Hi there, I'm SnappingVlsi 👋

### 🚀 Demystifying VLSI Physical Design 

Welcome to my digital workspace! I am an engineer and content creator passionate about the semiconductor industry. This GitHub profile serves as the central hub for the VLSI Physical Design theory, concepts, and information I share across my social platforms. 

Whether you are a student exploring chip design or a professional brushing up on physical design flows, you'll find resources here that align with my bite-sized content.

### 🧠 What I Share
On my platforms, I break down complex ASIC/SOC design concepts into digestible visual posts and short videos. My content focuses on:
* **Core Physical Design Flow:** Floorplanning, Placement, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), and Routing.
* **Timing & Analysis:** Static Timing Analysis (STA), setup/hold violations, and timing closure strategies.
* **Power & Signal Integrity:** IR Drop, Electromigration (EM), and low-power design techniques.
* **Industry Insights:** Tape-out challenges, EDA tool workflows, and semiconductor trends.
